# jupyterhub team activity

An experiment at providing high-level views on activity in the jupyterhub world.
This is not meant to be a full "dashboarding" project, and there is much
danger in relying too much on statistics for understanding. As such, the goal
of this repository is to make it easier to find pockets of interesting activity
across JupyterHub in order to dig-in further.
